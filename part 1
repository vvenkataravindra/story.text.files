"You'll regret this later", these words of the recent past had come back, rather abruptly.

My shadow was right in warning me earlier.I should have listened to him.If I had, I wouldnot have been in a tricky situation as such.



I felt a strong sense of loneliness.I missed my shadow's company every minute now.

While he was just being logical in asking me to accompany him, I was being stupidly emotional.It was the decision of staying back that had cost me dearly.

As I realised this fact, I longed to see my shadow again.But for that I needed to convince my librarian, which in itself was some task.I didnot want to speculate on the reaction from her end.I would simply ask her when I feel an opening.


For as far as I can remember, I was going through the same routine, in this strange town, without any sorts of deviation.Everything seemed to be perfect yet something was not, as there is no such concept of a 'perfect' thing.


Like any other day, I went to the library to perform the task of 'dream reading'.The librarian, who was also a friend of mine, had accompanied me.
After a while, I started the conversation, first of the day.


"I am curious regarding the lake that we visited sometime ago.What do you think lies on its other side?"

"Even I am a bit curious but we can't risk it.", she quietly said in a librarian's tone.

"But I think that we will be good, having some adventure."  My response.

"Let me make it clear that I can't risk losing someone dear to me yet again.So, its better to leave this at it.",she said.

A little conversation ensured that this wasn't going anywhere.I would have to take my own call at the appropriate hour.

 
Soon, I found myself facing the lake.I stood there awkwardly,trying to get my body to jump into it.Given the cold weather surrounding me at this dark hour,it took some time.I thought for one last time of my shadow and smirked at the thought of it.

And I finally did it. Sorry my dear librarian.
