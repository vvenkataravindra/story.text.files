I got up, and noticed my surroundings:close to morning hours.I was at a park and it was empty.I couldnot recollect the exact amount of time I was asleep.I got up and dusted myself.I went to a bench nearby and sat down.


As I try to dig into the details, I notice that my memory seems convoluted.'Strange!', I thought.

Sat there for a few more minutes, closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathing pattern.Nothing unusual.

'This is definitely not a dream.', my mind said.

Bored after a while, I decided to go for a walk.I noticed that the signboards of the park are in a strange language,one that I cannot interpret.The strong breeze, courtesy dawn, had forced me to pocket my hands.

To my amusement I found some coins in my left pocket.On closer notice, I found that it belonged to a scientist. In my right pocket there was a business card, printed on two sides: one was my native tongue and the other in which some letters seemed to match the signboards.

Upon reading the card, I could regain certain generic details such as my past,profession and my personal life.

It goes something like this:


circa. 1943
I used to work as a "Calcutec", an odd profession, for the "Organisation".Halfway through our project on "Sound Removal", I find out the truth about my employer,"The Scientist", that he had been using me all this time for his crazy experimentations without my formal consent.I was too naive for him.
I was frustrated to know that I had only a few (~48) hours left to live as his experiment had failed miserably.Not knowing how to spend the little amount of time that remained, I decided to go out for a meal, do some shopping and finally as the time was closing in, I moved to a garden and fell asleep.


These details had only worsened my current mood.I felt a sense of rage inside me.I had to channel it to my purpose of confronting my employer:The absent-minded scientist.

The card in my hand was the trigger.

I move out of the park and look around, hoping to find someone that could help me with the directions to the place mentioned on the card.
I saw someone.
It was a teenager dressed in mild pink. She looked at me sceptically.

'Maybe due to my Asian features', I thought.I didnot speak a word, instead just handed her the card.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


After a few hiccups, I finally managed to reach the place.Given that I was not as familiar to this country as Japan, I took more time figuring out directions than the usual.

I reached the third floor using an elevator.As I entered the work area, I came across a receptionist.I handed the card over to her(since that's all I have) and waited for the person mentioned on it.

I was guided through the office and we reached his cabin after a while.It was "some-sound-proof" cubicle.

There was a stoic expression on his face.

"I didnot expect, in the least, that we would be meeting again!", said the scientist.

Strangely, I couldnot channel my rage towards him.Partly due to the surroundings,I guess.

"What is this place?!", I asked calmly.

"Oh! I forgot, you must have regained your senses recently.Let me help you out.",he said and began.

"My dear 'Calcutec' , we are situated in the US.The year is 1945.I had relocated from Finland,last year.We are the same organisation,only a different branch.I had left my grand-daughter as the incharge of our headquaters back in Japan.

As per the request of our(Japanese) government,I had started a new project and your help would be appreciated.I must tell you that the current state of Imperial Japan is: "defeated".We had to surrender to the US shortly after the bombings on Hiroshima & Nagasaki.Sad truth", he added.


"We have been defeated by the US?!",I exclaimed with a thought to myself that a lot had been going on since my last memory of our world.

"It's a nice thing that we managed to escape beforehand, courtesy our high-level network of spies all around.But think of being here(in the US) at such times, it is truly bizzare.However, let me assure you that we would have to be cautious and ready to relocate at a short notice.", continued the scientist adjusting the frame of his glasses.

I didn't know how to respond.The fact that my country had been defeated and we were now located in the territory of our victors seemed a bit ironic and intimidating.

After a while I responded.

"Really upset with the circumstances.Since I don't have much of an option, I would like you to specify the project details and also arrange for my stay.", I said.

"That would be taken care of.In the mean time, you may move around within this building.", came in an instant reply.

With that being said,I took his leave and landed on the fifth floor of our building which had twelve such floors, I believe.

No particular reason,I just wanted to get familiar with my surroundings.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Day, Same Place.

"We 'resurrected' you to access the comprehensive data on horse species,which can be found within your subconscious mind.", began the scientist."Our project deals with the study of horse breeds, in the context of native American landscape."

 
I only nodded trying to understand it.But I couldn't.

The elderly scientist sighed.The kind of sigh, you would find when you cannot say, if you are bad at explaining stuff (or) if the listener is dumb.


"Let me rephrase that for you:  I have been working on this project-"Sound-of-Saddle" for the past two years.It was originally intended for trying to make horses see the light of the day back in our home:Japan. But, ofcourse it has taken an ugly turn with the recent events globally a.k.a the World War II.So official orders were given to find out the most important horse breed and make it go extinct.", he said.


'That's the most ridiculous turn of intentions I have ever seen.', I thought to myself.


"Can't help it son! Orders are meant to be followed.Imperial Japan might not be functional anymore.But I am someone who was brought up in the Imperial era.Hard-wired tendencies donot change easily.", he elaborated.


'What a drag! If the US finds it out then we will be done for.', I thought, tensed.


"Is it even practical to make something go extinct in the first place?", I asked after a gap.His idea did not seem practical.


"It's a slow-burn and certainly takes time.That's where you come into the scheme of things."


"I want you to process the data on different breeds of horses and come up with a particular combination of the most important type and its grazing habits!", he said.

"The idea is to get the right combination and just reverse the process to have an opposite effect.We have to strike, taking both the economic and psyche factors of this nation into consideration.That would do.", he continued.


"Grazing habits, Seriously?! I am not even sure of my own dinner, and you want me to compile data regarding grazing horses?", I exclaimed.


"HORSES. Well, the North American continent considers them to be special.Currently the statistics point out that horse trade is booming like never before.If we manage to accomplish our task,it will be a big win for us from the economic end.Also it would hurt the average American sentiment to be unable to protect a horse of all the other animals.", explained the old scientist.


Again, I agreed hesitantly to the task without any further enquiry.I needed some time for that input data to sink in.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I began the task at hand right away.I sat still, trying to find the file location through my convoluted consciousness.It took longer than I expected.After a few hours, I got up for a coffee break.

This routine had continued for 3 full days, with minor variations.I was tired of trying to get access to my subconscious mind.In the process, my body was also hazed to the core, but my mind kept swimming swiftly around through the convoluted waterways of my consciousness, like a restless aquatic organism.

Then one afternoon, it happened.I got through and finally found the file.I rushed to the old man's cabin immediately.He didnot seem to notice my arrival.He seemed to be lost in his own world.I didnot disturb him.

After what seemed to be close to eight minutes, he finally moved.I told him about the file regarding 'horse data'.He got a little too excited for his age and nearly strained his knee.I smirked subtly.He didnot seem to notice it.


I handed over the data to him and told that I would be going incognito, just for a while.He agreed.Afterall, my task was completed.

He mentioned that he would need some time to get the logistics of our project [Sound-of-Saddle] right, before the actual implementation.He would certainly assign the task to his team of '6 calcutecs'.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had received a call from the "Organisation" during the later part of my incognito days.I was shocked as the sentences from the other end came to a halt.Here's a summary of the conversation:


"The CIA had come to know of our project [Sound-of-Saddle] from the National Saddle Horse Breeders Association (NSHBA).Apparently, someone from the core team had leaked vital information.As per some rumors,the accused was an American guy.I also came to know that our Organisation had hired him earlie, specifically for this project, so as to get first-hand record of the conditions of N.America and Canada."


Oh the irony.Our Organisation had been using an American person to act against his own country.


The US had been on the alert and were spying on foreign organisations based in their country.Given the outcome of the WW-II, the concerned authorities had taken swift action and had halted the execution of our project.What a sad closure to our two-year efforts.The scientist was apparently taken into custody and would be interrogated shortly.I couldn't state the outcome of it, as I was not familiar with the laws/rules of this nation."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'What now?' was my first thought to these events.How do I get back to my home country? That's all I cared,no sympathy for the scientist.
I had no emotion as I sat there, on a garden bench.The garden was empty as usual,no dew.

No use getting stressed.I waited for something to happen.But sadly nothing happened.



Getting back to my building was the only option I had, and the only thing in my favor was: I had formatted the details of project[Sound-of-Saddle] from my memory.In a way, this meant I was no longer the part of the Organisation.

I have decided that I would head back to Japan,but only after assessing the situation at our building.I longed for my homeland.


I took the lift, one couldn't say whether it was going up or down due to its pace.I placed my hands into pockets and started counting the coins.I was able to count the change of both my pockets simultaneously.
